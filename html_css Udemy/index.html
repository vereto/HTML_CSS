    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="#nowhere">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses.The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the
      unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is
      alarmed.

    <h2>Range and Habitat</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for
      control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and
      other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish (including
      sharks), seals, seabirds, humans, and other cuttlefish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
      invertebrates.[3] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body
      size ratios of all invertebrates.[3]

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>Visual System</h2>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The
      organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally
      differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[17] Superficial
      similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be
      examples of convergent evolution.

    <h2>Cuttlebone</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone,
      which is porous and is made of aragonite. The pores provide it with
      buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid
      ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[15
